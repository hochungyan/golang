Read main file and play with a bits there: set bit, clear bit etc.

TO CODE: 
Use my template and make an app that do:

- Ask user for input and save that in a file
- Perform some operations on bits and show the result in bin format (yeah, there must be another user input)
- Save the value after user type "exit"
- Implement "clean up" operation - file must be deleted after user type "clean" as an input
- Implement "help" command
